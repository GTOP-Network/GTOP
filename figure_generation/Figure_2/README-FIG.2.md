This directory contains the scripts for generating Figure 2:
* Figure 2A: Multidimensional scaling (MDS) of full-length RNA-seq samples based on transcript-level expression.
* Figure 2B: Number of transcripts identified by GTOP full-length RNA-seq data compared with GENCODE v47 annotation.
* Figure 2C: Classification and predicted coding potential of transcripts annotated by SQANTI3.
* Figure 2D: Proportion of alternative splicing events of GTOP novel transcripts relative to GENCODE v47.
* Figure 2E: Frequency distribution of the number of tissues with expressed transcript, stratified by novel transcripts and GENCODE-annotated transcripts.
* Figure 2F: Proportion of transcript with proteomic support across tissues, stratified by uniquely mapping and shared peptides.
* Figure 2G: Heatmap illustrating expression patterns of 17 WGCNA co-expression network modules across six cardiac tissues.
* Figure 2H: Number of expressed genes used to analyze allele-specific expression (ASE) and allele-specific transcript structure (ASTS) and the subset exhibiting significant ASE and ASTS events.
* Figure 2I: Distribution of the number of gene exhibiting ASE and ASTS in 33 tissues.
