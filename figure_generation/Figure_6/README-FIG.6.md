# Figure 6 generation
***
This directory contains the scripts for generating Figure 6:
* Figure 6A: GWAS enrichment of cis-eQTLs and cis-sQTLs measured with different approaches.
* Figure 6B: Stacked bars show the number of colocalized GWAS loci by eQTL (green), sQTL (blue), and both (purple). Each bar represents one trait and bars were ordered by domain of traits as indicated by the color bars at _x_-axis. Venn diagram showing the number of colocalized genes and SMR detected genes.
* Figure 6C: The number of colocalized genes in GTOP comparing to the datasets in GTEx, the Japan COVID-19 Task Force (JCTF), and Multi-ancestry Analysis of Gene Expression (MAGE).
* Figure 6D: LocusCompare plots illustrating the colocalization between ADAP1 cis-eQTLs and Crohn's disease in GTOP , but not in GTEx. 
* Figure 6E: Proportion of GWAS variants overlapping QTLs.
* Figure 6F: Proportion of GWAS risk variants overlapping with QTL variants, stratified by variant frequency across ancestry groups.
* Figure 6G: Upset plot characterizes the number of colocalized signals containing fine-mapped SV/TRs.
* Figure 6H: LocusZoom plots for breast cancer GWAS signal and CASP8 SNV-eQTL signal and SV-eQTL signal.
