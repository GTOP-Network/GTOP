This directory contains plotting code for the following figures:
* Extend_Figure1: Comparison of genetic variants detected by long-read sequencing (LRS) and short-read sequencing (SRS).
* Extend_Figure2: Transcript discovery, quantification and peptide validation.
* Extend_Figure3: Identifying allele-specific expression (ASE) and allele-specific transcript structure (ASTS) by long-read RNA-seq data across tissues.
* Extend_Figure4: Characteristics of molecular QTLs across variant classes. 
* Extend_Figure5: Tissue-sharing and context-dependent patterns of molecular QTLs across variant classes.
* Extend_Figure6: Characterization molecular QTLs across variant classes.
* Extend_Figure7: Cross-ancestry fine-mapping of eQTLs between GTOP and GTEx.
* Extend_Figure8: Widespread of SV-eQTLs and TR-eQTLs across tissues were poorly tagged by small variants-based eQTLs.
* Extend_Figure9: Characteristics of risk variant associated genes.
